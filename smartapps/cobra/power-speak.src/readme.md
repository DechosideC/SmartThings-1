Power Speak


This little app will speak a (configurable) message if power reported goes above a configured level.
You also have the ability to add a delay between messages if multiple triggers occur

The app will also turn a switch on if above the preconfigured level and off if below (optional)
This switch could just be a standard 'virtual' switch used to indicate when power is being drawn above the configured level
