Who took the car



*  Design Usage:
 *  This was designed to indicate who took a shared car..... 
 *  It was created as a response to the creation of a special DTH:
 *  This DTH was originally developed by SmartThings for a garage door, 
 *  then modified by Robin Winbourne for use with a dog feeder to give access to four 'states'.
 *  Then modified by me (@cobra) to change the text/colours/icons to be able to use it to show who took a shared car :)




App description: Sets a virtual switch when a car leaves, and tries to work out who took it

You will need the following DTH to go with this:
