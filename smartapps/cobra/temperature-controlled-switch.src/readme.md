Temperature Controlled Switch

 *  Design Usage:
 *  This was designed to control a heater - turning on/off with varying temperatures.
 *  It has an optional 'override' switch and configurable restrictions on when it can run",
 *  You can use a special virtual device (using my Custom Temperature Controller DTH) to quickly vary the temperature settings.
